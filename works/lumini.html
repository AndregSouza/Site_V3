        <h3>Empowering Students</h3>
        <p>We have all been there. High school is coming to an end, and we still don&#x27;t have an answer to the famous question: &quot;What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot;. We freeze because, no matter how exciting our options sound, we start to feel claustrophobic as we get closer to making our final decision.<br>‍<br>To understand the scale of this problem, we started looking for quantitative research. We found out that only 41% of students graduate from college in four years. In addition, 30% of students drop out of college after their first year, and 11.6% of students who drop out will transfer and get their degrees elsewhere.<br><br>We aimed to redesign a new career model choice where students can improve their self-knowledge and get in touch with professions, to make a responsible and confident decision.</p>

        <p>At the start of the project, we didn&#x27;t have a defined scope or specific goals for the career choice experience. To ensure we had viable user value and impact, we conducted a series of user research sessions.</p>

        <h4>What does “Career” mean to you?</h4>
        <p>We interviewed five high school and ten undergrad students in São Paulo. We aimed to gather insights into how they feel, perceive, and think about career choices.<br><br>It was a great opportunity because we could get the perspectives from both sides and grasp the frustrations they face. Some of the early insights are shared below.</p>

        <p>I was amazed by the issues we found. Most of the student&#x27;s inputs and challenges reminded me of the same problems I faced when deciding on my career years ago. In addition, it became evident that current solutions failed to address the situation&#x27;s complexity while also being unavailable for every student.</p>

        <h3>Shaping the Future of Career Choices</h3>
        <p>Before we could jump into designing, it was essential to have a holistic understanding of the broader challenges students face and the steps required for a scalable career choice experience.<br><br>After much time buried in the academic research and literature, we unpacked the concept of the perfect career choice experience based on &quot;professional maturity&quot; by Super in 1955 and modeled for the dimensions of Determination, Responsibility, Independence, Self Awareness, and Market Knowledge.</p>
